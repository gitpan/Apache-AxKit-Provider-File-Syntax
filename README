Apache::AxKit::Provider::File::Syntax

   A file syntax provider for AxKit

Apache::AxKit::Provider::File::Syntax processes a requested file and,
instead of outputting it verbatim, it marks the file up as XML
representing the syntax of the source document.  This is very useful
for displaying JavaScript, Perl, or other non-XML markup and
syntax-colorizing it for display on a website.

Installation
============

If you have all the pre-requisites installed you just run:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test
 # as superuser
 $ make install

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself.
